# AliClean
A userscript to clean up Aliexpress URLs

The script was initially made by a user in #reprap on freenode IRC, but I sadly have forgotten by who :(

After almost loosing this userscript >10 times, to find it on weird nas drives or old computers,
I decided to put it in a place I could find again.

I also cleaned up the script a bit, added update capability


If you have a userscript plugin like:

  - [Violentmonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
  - [Violentmonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)
  - [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
  - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
  - [other Browsers](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark-Script/wiki/Install)

Then you can [install it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duckle29/AliClean/master/AliClean.user.js)
