# AliClean
A userscript to clean up Aliexpress URLs

The script was initially made by a user in #reprap on freenode IRC, but I sadly have forgotten by who :(

After almost loosing this userscript >10 times, to find it on weird nas drives or old computers,
I decided to put it in a place I could find again.

I also cleaned up the script a bit, added update capability, and [one-click install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duckle29/AliClean/master/AliClean.user.js) ability :) (if you have a userscript pluging, like tampermonkey)
